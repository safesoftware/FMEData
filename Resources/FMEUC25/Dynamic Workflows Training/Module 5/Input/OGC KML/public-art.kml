<td>A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. 
Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in "Roman bronze". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.
An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. 
Matthews: "Mr. Townley, the "Sun" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it."
Townley: "What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the "home for incurable dogs", or some other idiotic thing".
Matthews: "Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the "Sun" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in."
Townley: "Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that..."
The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.</td>

<td>Seventy-four upright cedar blocks, 3'x3' each by varying heights from 2' to 17' and each set in a 6" base. These timbers are set on end in a seemingly random pattern on six concrete pads in the middle of Granville Square and mostly enclosed within a 50 foot diameter circle of red tiles. The sculpture measures about 40 feet by 60 feet and is roughly in the shape of a cross.  Known as "Phifer's Fountain", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said "a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept." (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as "developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc." Somewhere along the line, the "fountain" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.
"The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes." (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)
By 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza. Some effort was made to find a new home for this quintessential 70s work, with the artist choosing to give it to the interior community of Princeton, where it currently stands as the gateway to the Trans Canada Trail. http://town.princeton.bc.ca/newpages/parksandrec/phifersfount.html#</td>

One of the underlying references is the many streams that once flowed into False Creek.

The pond’s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.

As the pedestrian moves into the space the sound of the falling water becomes more dominant till the extraneous sounds of the street are entirely absorbed offering respite and perhaps an opportunity for further engagement and reflection.</td>

<td>A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park. In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown&#39;s initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location. Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. &quot;When I couldn&#39;t get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.&quot; A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci&#39;s foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 80 feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. &quot;Girl in Wetsuit&quot; has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.</td>

<td>A 12-foot-long stylized rocket ship made of bronze and stainless steel sits on top of an 11-foot-high stainless steel base. The design of the rocket ship looks like a 1950s Hollywood movie space ship. The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.
The City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280</td>

This artwork was officially deaccessioned November 2020. After an extensive redevelopment of the area surrounding Rogers Arena, resituating the artwork became unfeasible within the revised ground plan. As well, the artist had requested that The Game not be re-installed, stating that it was created for a time and place that no longer exist, and that the work is not relevant for other contexts.

The City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.

<td>"In reference to the library, the theme can be read as fragments which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a larger picture much as one accesses the library in quest of materials to fit in gaps of knowledge or time.
The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in "Technics and Civilization" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the "ruins" of a clock face. 
Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.
With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars. This notion of "mutable reality" is a familiar theme in my work, which seeks to explore the boundaries of realism and representation:  Time... History... Motion... Imagination... Reflection…</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">"In reference to the library, the theme can be read as fragments which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a larger picture much as one accesses the library in quest of materials to fit in gaps of knowledge or time.
The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in "Technics and Civilization" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the "ruins" of a clock face. 
Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.
With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars. This notion of "mutable reality" is a familiar theme in my work, which seeks to explore the boundaries of realism and representation:  Time... History... Motion... Imagination... Reflection…</SimpleData>

It is directed at those who operate our free-market economy in their own interests, while excluding those interests that would be 'responsive to the needs of the community'.

Walter raises questions related to the systems underlying the transactions and power-plays that constitute normal business in the world of real estate development. In Walter's art the museum without walls is also a museum OF walls, walls  new and old, as well as those walls that perpetuate economic class distinctions.  Her text on the façade of the Del-Mar Hotel will stand as a witness to the various power-plays, including the threat to move B.C. Hydro's head office to the suburb of Burnaby, that led to the development surrounding 553-555 Hamilton Street." - from "The Interventions of Kathryn Walter" by Bill Jeffries, Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1990</td>

In Walter's art the museum without walls is also a museum OF walls, walls  new and old, as well as those walls that perpetuate economic class distinctions.  Her text on the façade of the Del-Mar Hotel will stand as a witness to the various power-plays, including the threat to move B.C. Hydro's head office to the suburb of Burnaby, that led to the development surrounding 553-555 Hamilton Street." - from "The Interventions of Kathryn Walter" by Bill Jeffries, Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver, 1990</SimpleData>

<td>"The carved figures tell the story of Man, taken care of by the spirits, who wandered the empty earth. Lonely, he went to the forest aned asked the Spirit of the Forest, "Why am I alone? Isn't there anyone in the forest to help me?" The spirit said, "I will give you Black Bear. If you can live in harmony with him, I will send you more of my children." He did, and Man learned to live in peace with the forest people.

Paddling on the sea, Man asked the Spirit of the Sea, "Why am I alone on the water?" The spirit said, "I will send you Blackfish; If you learn to live with him, I will send you more of my children." He did, and Man learned to live in peace with the people of the sea.

Noticing the emptiness of the sky one day, Man said to the Spirit of the Sky, "Send me one of your children, for I have twice shown tha ti can live with other than myself." The Spirit of the Sky send him Raven, and Man again  proved he could live in harmony with the other creatures.

That humans can live together with the children of the forest, the water and the sky is evidneced by the many animals, fish and birds that still aboun in these habitaats. If wwwe can learn to live in peace with such diverse creatures, we can surely live in peace with each other." (from Stewart, Totem Poles, 1990)</td>

<td>The project was designed to work with a team of street-involved youth with the purpose of building connections within a diverse community through creating permanent public artworks. In May 2002, the team began designing artworks, determining site details, planning workshops and doing outreach. Through this process several artworks comprised of mosaic tile pieces and glaze painted tiles were created. Our confirmed sites are as follows: "The theme for the project is ‘Life Journeys’. Examples of this theme are: images relating to growth and renewal or someone who the artist has connected with in their life, dedications or commemorations about someone who has been important on one’s life journey, or someone important to the artist who has passed on." (from the Roundhouse web site) Works are installed at the  Gathering Place, the Roundhouse, the Downtown South Park and David Lam Park.                             Watch yOUR Step would like to thank partners, The Roundhouse Community Arts & Recreation Centre, The Gathering Place, and Street Youth Services; funders, Vancouver Foundation, The Roundhouse Community Arts & Recreation Centre, City Office of Cultural Affairs Community Public Art Program, John Hardie Mitchell Family Foundation, and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation Neighbourhood Matching Funds; and sponsors, Milestones, Subway, Jugo Juice, Starbucks, Bagel Street Café, Panago Pizza, Stoneslab Pizza, Capers, Quiznos, Capers, Book Warehouse, and especially Soup Etc. and Yaletown Market, for their generous contributions to this project.</td>

<td>Mosaics depicting colourful motifs were designed by groups of young people with the guidance of Artistic Director Leah Decter. They were designed for four sites: Downtown South Park, Gathering Place Community Centre, the Roundhouse, and David Lam Park. Decter had assistance from Dan Hill and Valerie Methot and the youth team members Stephen Blackwater, Matt Ellis, Jessie Ford, Alex Irvine, and Ally Niell with some help from Twitchy. Early planning participants included Speedy, Babette, Gabe, Sky, Twitchy, Michelle, and Kris. The works were created by the team members, street youth participants and other community members.

Location of mosaics:

David Lam Park: In-ground on the pathway at SE corner of the open lawn.

Yaletown Roundhouse: On a wall by the bike racks at the Pacific Blvd. side.

Emery Barnes Park: In-ground surrounding the seating area and fountain on East side of park.

Gathering Place Community Center: Two murals on exterior wall of building along Helmcken St.</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">The project was designed to work with a team of street-involved youth with the purpose of building connections within a diverse community through creating permanent public artworks. In May 2002, the team began designing artworks, determining site details, planning workshops and doing outreach. Through this process several artworks comprised of mosaic tile pieces and glaze painted tiles were created. Our confirmed sites are as follows: "The theme for the project is ‘Life Journeys’. Examples of this theme are: images relating to growth and renewal or someone who the artist has connected with in their life, dedications or commemorations about someone who has been important on one’s life journey, or someone important to the artist who has passed on." (from the Roundhouse web site) Works are installed at the  Gathering Place, the Roundhouse, the Downtown South Park and David Lam Park.                             Watch yOUR Step would like to thank partners, The Roundhouse Community Arts &amp; Recreation Centre, The Gathering Place, and Street Youth Services; funders, Vancouver Foundation, The Roundhouse Community Arts &amp; Recreation Centre, City Office of Cultural Affairs Community Public Art Program, John Hardie Mitchell Family Foundation, and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation Neighbourhood Matching Funds; and sponsors, Milestones, Subway, Jugo Juice, Starbucks, Bagel Street Café, Panago Pizza, Stoneslab Pizza, Capers, Quiznos, Capers, Book Warehouse, and especially Soup Etc. and Yaletown Market, for their generous contributions to this project.</SimpleData>

The objects are things you would normally carry in your pockets: notes, bus tickets, loose change, etc." Re door and window frames: Our intention is to raise questions around ideas of ownership of and entitlement to the city: whose city?  Do we feel the city belongs to us because it is 'public'?  Or do we think of entitlement in terms of private property: what we own or don't own?" Regarding the weathervanes: "The turning of the signs in the wind functions as metaphor for shifting notions of community, place, and a sense of entitlement we feel as citizens."    "The title "Right to the City" comes from the urban theorist Henri Lefebvre's text by the same name which calls for a different envisioning of the city: for it to be organized for, and belong to, its inhabitants, rather than organized for profit.  The elements in this project explore the contradictions and ambiguities of public and private space.  Although we can identify in general with Vancouver as 'our city', as belonging to the public, space in the city is clearly delineated: either it belong to you or id doesn't.  The space along Nanaimo is technically public space, and unlike the neighbouring yards, anyone can go on this space.  However, in the larger scheme of things, do we feel entitled to it as a space?  We're interested in drawing attention to the public nature of this space and the claims made on the city.  Related to these ideas, this artwork addresses the ephemeral, shifting nature of the site, both in terms of the physical environment and cultural priorities.  This area was once a vacant lot and is now a small park.  We hope the work will open up a space for contemplation and reconsideration on the meaning of these transitions.  This is a chance to look at the neighbourhood in another way, and by extension, the city."  (from the Artists' Statement, 2004)</td>

The frames also have plates with possessive pronouns cut out of them: ours, yours, his, hers, mine, theirs.  3) Two weathervanes located on southeast and northwest corners of Clarendon and 45th Avenue.  The weathervanes are mounted on 12' poles.  They are comprised of a bearing assembly, a shaft  and a rectangular sign that turns in the wind with the words "yours" and "ours" cut out.

<th>artistprojectstatement</th>
<td>Excerpted from (RE)VIEWING PRIVATE CHILDHOODS IN PUBLIC PLACES: AN ANALYSIS OF KEN LUM&rsquo;S A TALE OF TWO CHILDREN by Alice Stratford-Kurus.

A Tale of Two Children demonstrates Lum&rsquo;s artistic engagement with social issues of the everyday. Particularly, this work examines the upbringing of a child, not just the child as product of upbringing but, in terms of his or her relationship to others and the moments that influence the child. It is not only the child who is examined but the viewer, too, is drawn into the work and provoked to reflect on their own childhood.

The image that comprises the left half of the installation...undermines the idea that children are insulated or exempt from adult feelings of suffering. The boy is vulnerable, intimidated, and sad [and the] tone is harsh, negative, and angry, obviously detrimental to the boy&rsquo;s self-worth.

The right-hand image text supports the idea that it is a mother who is speaking affectionately to her daughter. At some level, this may translate into pressure that is put on the child to succeed. Issues of race and culture are interwoven with concepts of child-rearing.

Lum&rsquo;s A Tale of Two Children, through the two scenes, illustrates two different points on a large spectrum of parenting. Race, is one factor among many that influences child-rearing. Socio-economic and cultural backgrounds effect the relationship between parent and child as well. Lum conveys the multiplicity of parenting. The work is personal, local, and intimate while at the same time anonymous, global, and public. The complexity of the artwork mirrors the intricate multiplicity of childhood itself.</td>

The right-hand image text supports the idea that it is a mother who is speaking affectionately to her daughter. At some level, this may translate into pressure that is put on the child to succeed. Issues of race and culture are interwoven with concepts of child-rearing.

Lum&amp;rsquo;s A Tale of Two Children, through the two scenes, illustrates two different points on a large spectrum of parenting. Race, is one factor among many that influences child-rearing. Socio-economic and cultural backgrounds effect the relationship between parent and child as well. Lum conveys the multiplicity of parenting. The work is personal, local, and intimate while at the same time anonymous, global, and public. The complexity of the artwork mirrors the intricate multiplicity of childhood itself.</SimpleData>

A Coast Salish Dancer shows a human figure holding a sea serpent rattle and above it, the Thunderbird, the most powerful of all spirits and a symbol of protection. On the opposite face of the Dancer, tree roots connect us to the land, sea and sky.  The Killer Whale upright depicts five whales, each with a raven fin and salmon pectoral, representing the close link between humans and orcas. The Salish believe that when great chiefs die, they become killer whales. The crossbeam is carved with a Salish textile motif.</td>

<td>Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community College’s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.

Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.

Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.

This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.

On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.</td>

<td>As part of Instant Coffee's self-proclaimed “Year of Bright Days,” the exhibit, A Bright Future was a four part public commission for "88 BLOCKS Art on Main". Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.

For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like "it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and "get social or get lost." It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. 

Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount. Instant Coffee offered a moment of solace; only fifteen minutes at the bus shelter was needed for a daily dose of vitamin D and a brighter future.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">A Bright Future</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">As part of Instant Coffee's self-proclaimed “Year of Bright Days,” the exhibit, A Bright Future was a four part public commission for "88 BLOCKS Art on Main". Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.

For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like "it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and "get social or get lost." It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. 

Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount. Instant Coffee offered a moment of solace; only fifteen minutes at the bus shelter was needed for a daily dose of vitamin D and a brighter future.</SimpleData>

<td>THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE [was] a text-based work made in response to the context, building and public surrounds of the Vancouver Public Library. The work takes the form of a large freestanding sign that sits in front of the VPL just off the southern entrance of the building in a heavy pedestrian traffic area. The sign takes its cues from an era of signage when signs were once seen as celebratory, grand and iconic &ndash; in effect, as landmarks in their own right as a kind of symbolic architecture (think: Caesars Palace, The Flamingo, The Stardust &ndash; to the landmark of all landmarks, Hollywood). In tracing this lineage, the work also acknowledges a local history when Vancouver was once seen as one of the neon-light capitals of North America. Reminders of this once past persists in signs like BOW-MAC &ldquo;on Broadway&rdquo; (now retro-fitted with the Toys R&rsquo; Us sign) and of course the W atop of what once was the Woodward&rsquo;s building. In adopting the form of a sign, THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE elides the classifications of traditional sculpture, by evoking a typology that is at once familiar and accessible. Taken within the context of a public library, the work touches upon &ndash; in a very poetic way &ndash; the use of words and language as boundless and imaginative, as a catalyst for a multiplicity of meanings.</td>

<td>My pieces are about concerns which play an important role in everyday life as well as in art, in painting, sculpture, architecture: space—movement—time—light. My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.

The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. 

Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light—daylight and artificial light—exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it. I am very interested in all these special qualities.</td>

<td>Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that was on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero&rsquo;s project was visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery. Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offered a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incited inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated. As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero&rsquo;s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas &ndash; water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death. This work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;discover,&rdquo; and &ldquo;celebrate,&rdquo; the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">Passage</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that was on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero&amp;rsquo;s project was visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery. Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offered a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incited inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated. As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero&amp;rsquo;s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas &amp;ndash; water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death. This work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as &amp;ldquo;dream,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;discover,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;celebrate,&amp;rdquo; the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.</SimpleData>

<td>We Are Watching, 2010 is a participatory video exhibition that teases ideas focused on public space, surveillance, public art policy and representational power. There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants’ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.

Participation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. 

There is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the “official” versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver. Multiple subjectivities will add complexity to this overarching image of Vancouver. 

Rina Liddle is a visual artist, researcher and educator. At the core of her practice is the belief that art making is a polyvocal practice. Her work often takes the form of installations and interventions that deal with ideas regarding public space, and include digital media, photography, sculptural elements and collaborations. The material forms that she chooses are, for her, a means to renegotiate and make visible the conditions of the social body. Or something like that. Do you know what I mean? Subtle traces of the absurd in sociological methodologies are discernable in her work.</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">The project is ongoing and will eventually represent all the provinces in Canada. The architecture of language used to describe the past is my continuing interest. Here the project uses a dichotomy of dis-similar visual information about the same subject. Rather than the often used before and after images of place, this work injects both the place and the former residents within the same dialogue about Vancouver's past.</SimpleData>

<td>Lines in architecture and art is a large photomural of a section of coastal landscape, focusing on the frieze of land where forest and water meet, commonly called the high-water mark or high tide line.  This naturally occurring, perfectly level line – made evident by the saltwater rising to the level of the overhanging trees, makes a natural reveal, a feature seen and used in architecture to visually divide the floor from the wall.

En route from the north coast back to Vancouver, I developed the idea to create this large format photographic mural.  A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.  In this proposed photomural we will see how the saltwater rises twice a day, cutting an acutely accurate level in the tree boughs as they hang down from the forest landscape.  My interest was first drawn to this subtle occurrence when I realized the visual similarity to the architectural reveal, seen in homes, galleries and museums, a feature that is essential in the contextualizing and display of artwork.

For this mural I decided to repeat the same photo three times in order to draw attention to the architectural references of this work and remove it from the genre of pure photographic documentation.

Situated within the public sphere this proposed photomural presents a very simple meeting of land and water, highlighting how we draw from different ecosystems, the ocean and the forest, to simultaneously sustain our city.  The allusion to the endless rise and fall of the tide will hopefully foster a connection to the changing of time and rethinking of urban space with an environmental sensitivity and an understanding of the shoreline that frames our city.</td>

<td>A new project by the City of Vancouver Public Art program invites the public to whistle - or sing - while they wait at bus stops across Vancouver. Adorno and Nose, a series of ten songs composed and illustrated by Barry Doupé andJames Douglas Whitman, will be installed from August 15 to October 2, 2011 at 10 locations (listed below) and is one of 13 new public art projects commissioned by the City of Vancouver's Public Art Program for Vancouver 125. 
 
Each poster consists of a song, notated as standard sheet music, the verse, and a drawn graphic. The songs are loosely structured and poetic and meant to engage those waiting for the bus. Complementing this public exhbition will be a performance of the songs on Saturday, September 3, 8pm at the Western Front, 303 East 8th Avenue.

<td>This work was commissioned by Reliance Properties. The desire was to have an integrated light art work on the concrete cores of the two towers that would set apart the building and at the same time relate to its surroundings.

The idea for the light installation was inspired by the natural surroundings.The city skyline holds a spectacular backdrop of mountains and water. But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building. The whole sequence takes more than 8 hours so it is not to be seen as a light show but more as a general presence.</td>

<td>The three images presented depict a single person reading in a serene Vancouver setting and are all inspired by Fragonard's lighthearted paintings of people enjoying the outdoors while reading. The images on their own work as studies in landscapes and reading, but from a distance can be viewed as an examination of primary colour. On one level, the works refer to modern painting and studies in abstraction. Consequently, the three images depict not only a solitary figure reading, but if one were to step back and view the works in their entirety, they would be overwhelmed by the graphic primary colour palette.</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">The three images presented depict a single person reading in a serene Vancouver setting and are all inspired by Fragonard's lighthearted paintings of people enjoying the outdoors while reading. The images on their own work as studies in landscapes and reading, but from a distance can be viewed as an examination of primary colour. On one level, the works refer to modern painting and studies in abstraction. Consequently, the three images depict not only a solitary figure reading, but if one were to step back and view the works in their entirety, they would be overwhelmed by the graphic primary colour palette.</SimpleData>

<td>"Southwest and Southeast Marine drive has always loomed in my mind as Vancouver’s spookiest strip. Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.

I’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.

Canadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems." - Douglas Coupland, 2012</td>

<td>As part of Vancouver’s 125th Anniversary, the City of Vancouver commissioned artist Sonny Assu to design a street marker to be installed along Kingsway from Main Street to Boundary Road. The signs mark Kingsway's shared history as an aboriginal foot trail and wagon road. The artwork incorporates the artists signature style of Pop-Culture-meets-Aboriginal Art to make this history visible in our daily lives. 

The marker is installed on both sides of Kingsway and mimics highway signs that identify the route, including a stylized maple leaf using coastal First Nations design elements.

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">“As an urban indigenous person calling Vancouver home for many years, I wanted to honour the First Peoples history and Musqueam, Squamish and Tsail-wututh Nations with my work... In a project to acknowledge Vancouver's 125 years, I recognized the inequality in that conception of history. Hidden in plain sight, it seems we forgot to acknowledge the first 9000 years.” - Sonny Assu</SimpleData>

<SimpleData name="descriptionofwork">As part of Vancouver’s 125th Anniversary, the City of Vancouver commissioned artist Sonny Assu to design a street marker to be installed along Kingsway from Main Street to Boundary Road. The signs mark Kingsway's shared history as an aboriginal foot trail and wagon road. The artwork incorporates the artists signature style of Pop-Culture-meets-Aboriginal Art to make this history visible in our daily lives. 

The marker is installed on both sides of Kingsway and mimics highway signs that identify the route, including a stylized maple leaf using coastal First Nations design elements. The project informs people of the ancient foot trail that connected the Fraser River and what later became New Westminster and False Creek and English Bay. The signs also acknowledge the early colonial history as a wagon road.</SimpleData>

<td>Four paddles of Salish design, represent the four directions, and contain images of Salish serpents, and other glyph forms. The tops of the largest paddle is in flames, alluding to the great fire of Vancouver in 1886, an event that left many from the early city trapped on the shores of the Burrard Inlet. Indians of the Coast Salish Squamish arrived in their dugout canoes to rescue people, sheltering them in their nearby village church. The poem that was sung as they paddled the inlet is inscribed on the bow of the canoe. The movement of the paddles is echoed in vertical bamboo along the left side, superimposed with the Hanji character meaning 'Harmony" and aims to emphasize the collaborative nature of this project as well as the unique characteristic of the Downtown Eastside where several cultures co-exist in harmony.</td>

<td>"The Underlying States" was a collaborative drawing project by Tania Willard, Gabrielle Hill, and Peter Morin that appeared as a series of four bus shelters throughout May of 2014. The images were created in the style of the exquisite corpse, a technique made popular by the surrealists in the early 20th century as a way of exploring the unconscious and associative powers of images. The three artists worked from different geographic areas, on-reserve and off, in urban and rural contexts, and these differences inform the imagery and speak to the complexity of Aboriginal identities. The images explore reconciliation through relationships to land, territory, nationhood and concepts of spirituality, faith and "wholeness."</td>

<td>Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a
decoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious
something else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?
Substation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,
creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that
contains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a
year with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.

<td>In my practice I consider a materials history and its economic and social settings along with processes which surround it. All of the materials I use begin with this type of investigation and in developing a response to a site for public art, I consider the area, what is present on it, who uses it (past, present and future) and this becomes equally as important to inform my material choices. For me the revealed language held in both the materials and site - visual, verbal, written and experiential - establishes an intimacy directly between the physical material, how it is used and its history within the site. Where these languages and forms of research collide is the place that I produce works from, with an intimate knowledge and informed reasoning for their applications.

I started this project, Walking Spectrum, by taking the map provided to the artists of the 2-minute walking radius from the site and followed the general shape of the map to photo document the area. In sampling colours, textures and shapes that presented themselves in the images a layout began that developed out of this walk and selection process. The newly developed pattern is one that stories walking the neighbourhood with visuals from a pedestrian point of view.

These sampled sections moved left to right, up and down to mimic the aim of the camera, allowing for the location of the sky, down to the street remain intact. In a way, these colours represent the story of the city at the very moment it was recorded in 2016, buildings go up and come down, materials change, leaves fall, signage and lights change, etc. This digital collage then becomes the subject for photographing but that creates a further fracturing of the image.

The choice to have the image hand painted rather than digitally replicated, is to draw out a warmth from the process; a soft geometry to measure against the crisp geometry that surrounds it in the predominant built environment. This sensibility is central to my practice, as I work with materials and processes closely and with intention.

The work will be accessible for day and night views with natural daylight and with the additional lighting that will wash down each glass panel and bounce up from the water feature at night. Walking Spectrum will anchor the space and site, invite a closer look using colour, texture, transparencies, arrayed patterns as it maps the visual story found in the city&rsquo;s time of transition</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">In my practice I consider a materials history and its economic and social settings along with processes which surround it. All of the materials I use begin with this type of investigation and in developing a response to a site for public art, I consider the area, what is present on it, who uses it (past, present and future) and this becomes equally as important to inform my material choices. For me the revealed language held in both the materials and site - visual, verbal, written and experiential - establishes an intimacy directly between the physical material, how it is used and its history within the site. Where these languages and forms of research collide is the place that I produce works from, with an intimate knowledge and informed reasoning for their applications.

I started this project, Walking Spectrum, by taking the map provided to the artists of the 2-minute walking radius from the site and followed the general shape of the map to photo document the area. In sampling colours, textures and shapes that presented themselves in the images a layout began that developed out of this walk and selection process. The newly developed pattern is one that stories walking the neighbourhood with visuals from a pedestrian point of view.

These sampled sections moved left to right, up and down to mimic the aim of the camera, allowing for the location of the sky, down to the street remain intact. In a way, these colours represent the story of the city at the very moment it was recorded in 2016, buildings go up and come down, materials change, leaves fall, signage and lights change, etc. This digital collage then becomes the subject for photographing but that creates a further fracturing of the image.

The choice to have the image hand painted rather than digitally replicated, is to draw out a warmth from the process; a soft geometry to measure against the crisp geometry that surrounds it in the predominant built environment. This sensibility is central to my practice, as I work with materials and processes closely and with intention.

The work will be accessible for day and night views with natural daylight and with the additional lighting that will wash down each glass panel and bounce up from the water feature at night. Walking Spectrum will anchor the space and site, invite a closer look using colour, texture, transparencies, arrayed patterns as it maps the visual story found in the city&amp;rsquo;s time of transition</SimpleData>

<td>“Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is the title of a text-and-image based work meant for installation at transit shelters. There is a certain fictional quality to the term “coastal city”, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. “From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. “Ukiyo” is a Japanese term meaning “the floating world”, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver’s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?
Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. “Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling. It epitomises how our coastline embodies our cultural makeup and experiences, and is a catalyst in triggering memories and starting conversations. Regardless of whether these stories are truth, fiction or somewhere in between, they nonetheless allow us to share our experiences without judgement.</td>

<td>My project for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City further develops two of my areas of interest: the shifting relationship between the digital and the physical, and the material, political, and ecological tension between the natural world and human-centered activities. Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences—from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water—are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. 
The project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. 
These references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and “textures” are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results—the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows. 
As these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement—their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye. Expanded to the size of transit shelter posters, the biomorphic ‘figures’ that populate my works approach human-scale, creating a unique form of engagement and experience. Particularly well suited to viewers in transit, the high contrast figure-ground compositions function as both graphically prominent from a distance, and visually complex on close viewing. This high fidelity fractal detail suggests the imagery of coastal scenery, while the ‘figures’, oscillating between plant-like and humanoid, point to the changing landscape as a consequence of human-centered activities. In this way, the works speak to Vancouver as both a coastal city and an important ecosystem, and allude to our responsibilities as we move within it.</td>

Working with traditional silver gelatin printing, the artist explores shifting relationships between physical and digital processes and evokes the tension between the natural world and human-centered activities in the urban environment.

<td>"I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.
 
    In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?"</td>

<td>Rainforest was designed in response to a call for public outdoor sculptures to be constructed and exhibited at Expo ‘86 in Vancouver. The piece was fabricated in Vanier Park during the summer of 1986 where visitors were invited to watch the construction process and interact with the artist.  The piece primarily consists of numerous parallel steel pipes intended to provide the sense of driving rain. Attached to many of these angled rain-like elements are shorter smaller pipes producing a simplified tree forms.   Interspersed among the pipe components are various objects associated with forestry; a crosscut saw, a baseball bat, a ladder, a house, all set at the identical angle to the tree branches.
The intention is to merge the visual sense of driving rain with trees and objects associated with forestry. Excessive repetition causes the piece to appear both chaotic and ordered.  Hopefully viewers can focus on any one of, or all of these elements simultaneously.</td>

<td>In the fall of 1909 a committee was formed to build a memorial to David Oppenheimer, former Mayor of Vancouver. Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, "These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.  Soon Vancouver will not have to propose dead sculptors to design memorials - there are and will be living and capable sculptors nearer home than on the other bank of the Styx.." The original budget for the project was $50,000, but by the time Marega was commissioned in 1910, the project had become a bust for $4500, of which Marega was paid $3600 and the balance paid for an elaborate unveiling ceremony.

<td>The parameters for the juried competition operated by Parks Canada were to create "a monument in Vanier Park to commemorate Captain George Vancouver," the first European to sail into Burrard Inlet, in 1792. The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, "not wood," and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, "The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast." The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice. Gordon Smith, a member of the selection panel, said that "If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away."  It was originally to be sited at Ferguson Point in Stanley Park.</td>

<td>The large steel sculpture is set on a 26' x 28' plaza of paving stones. The sculpture consists of a 15' square of corten steel. Each side of the square is 15' long by 3'  high by 3' wide. The bottom side appears to be cut apart in the middle and the two parts wrenched apart to form a gate or arch.  The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it "a bloody monstrosity." An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be "the world's largest paper clip." The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: "Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them."  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art "intervention". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the "Gate to the Northwest Passage" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek. The area around the site is a favorite for kite flyers.</td>

<td>The miracle of Terry Fox was that he was an ordinary young man who turned his response to pain and loss into a triumph of hope and courage. When Terry lost his right leg to cancer in 1977 he decided to raise funds for cancer research. He would run across Canada and ask every Canadian to join the fight against cancer by donating one dollar. He began his Marathon of Hope in Newfoundland on April 12, 1980 heading for the Pacific and home 5,300 miles away. As he ran his daily 26 miles, the lone figure with the distinctive hop-and-skip gait became a symbol that captured the imagination of a nation.  On September 2, Terry was forced to abandon his run when cancer was discovered in his lung. That morning he had written 3,318 miles under the date in his diary. But the Marathon of Hope was not over. Messages of affection and encouragement flooded in and donations to continue the battle against cancer, eventually totaled more than $30 million. In the last year of his brief life Terry received many honours, but Terry Fox will always be remembered most as the young man who demonstrated and took a nation along with him on his Marathon of Hope.

<td>The Salmon Wall was created as a means of fostering understanding between the Musqueam and Southlands communities. It was also envisioned as a process to encourage respect for the Musqueam people and their traditions in the non-Native community. The project was initiated by artist Alison Diesvelt who, together with the Southlands principal, identified Musqueam artist Debra Sparrow as a partner. Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions.

Along the walkway, a series of cast bronze pavers depict the growth rings of an ancient Douglas Fir.  Text cut into steel benches quote "First Nations, Spanish, and English phrases, person names, industries, flora and aquatic life that have been and are connected to this area".  A series of tree grates support images from hydrographic survey maps and references "the aviation industry that flourished in Coal Harbour".  Seven columns support bronze annular rings of a tree connecting visually with the inscribed pavers.  "The image in part reflects the lumber industry that also existed in the harbour.  Another reference is to time, as in counting the rings of a tree to determine the tree's age".  (From Artist Statement)</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">"Weave is intended as a visual narrative of the history and transformation of Coal Harbour and it's surrounding environment."  Along the walkway, a series of cast bronze pavers depict the growth rings of an ancient Douglas Fir.  Text cut into steel benches quote "First Nations, Spanish, and English phrases, person names, industries, flora and aquatic life that have been and are connected to this area".  A series of tree grates support images from hydrographic survey maps and references "the aviation industry that flourished in Coal Harbour".  Seven columns support bronze annular rings of a tree connecting visually with the inscribed pavers.  "The image in part reflects the lumber industry that also existed in the harbour.  Another reference is to time, as in counting the rings of a tree to determine the tree's age".  (From Artist Statement)</SimpleData>

<td>Over 300 volunteers representing a multicultural and multigenerational group worked with the artists for six months to design and create the mosaics in this project coordinated by the Native Education Centre.  A number of groups participated including Youth Against Violence, Purple Thistle Youth, Trout Lake Seniors, Eastside Alternative School and Fort Good Hope, and the NWT youth organization in Vancouver on an exchange program. The artists worked with participants to design the mosaics and they did the tile work. Here are a few comments from a listing of the mosaics and individual statements: "Swirl of Creation by Shelly Schnee, family and friends: Each child involved got to pick an animal to represent their origins. Parker picked Ogopogo to represent his dad's upbringing in Vernon. Conner picked Dolphins to represent our feeling of coming from the ocean. Melida picked the Quetzal to represent her family's Latin heritage.  We translated our political words 'Community, Struggle, and Freedom into Spanish, as well as to tie the two heritages together."  "Community by Nancy Sweedler and Allyson Prendergast:  My mosaic circle represents what dominates my physical space and heart.  It shows my house and the complex of houses that I live in, the greenery that surrounds us, the sky train that rushes through the neighbourhood (I live almost under it with my son Jake) and, central to everything, the people of all races and nationalities that I love and live amongst.  It is a pretty basic concept, but it means everything to me."</td>

<td>This project was the result of a long process of researching and photographing the local landscape and consultation with members of the community, Park Board and the School Board. The work consists of 16 in-ground and 4 above ground markers installed along the routes of four historical streams that once existed in Kitsilano. Each of the in-ground markers has the words LOST STREAM engraved around the outer edge. Each marker also contains engraved words on two themes; first, along the edges, two-word phrases for the agents of the demise of the stream e.g. "Logging railway" and second, in the centre, four kinds of plant and animal life that have disappeared e.g. "sockeye, thimbleberry, lynx and fir". Artist Marian Penner Bancroft writes, "...my desire became to find a way of recalling what was now invisible, of marking the routes of the streams and in doing so to call up an earlier image of this place, to bring some history into the present... I also installed at (Kitsilano) Community Centre a set of black and white photographs, two for each (stream) path. These are close up images of where the streams once were, paired with images of trees that are fed by the underground flows, those vestiges of another landscape." -from the Vancouver Park Board web site</td>

<td>On August 29th, 2006, I dug a grave by hand from beginning to end at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. This entire process, six hours and fifteen minutes, was captured on HD video in one continuous take. The static shot is composed from the side with the plot at the bottom of the frame. The video ends when I have completely disappeared from the frame and have stopped shoveling. This work was initially exhibited as a scale video projection at the Or Gallery, Vancouver, in February 2007. Along with the video, a scale photograph of the empty gravesite, taken from directly above, was exhibited. The proportions of the excavation (the standard dimensions of a gravesite) happen to be the same as a ‘tombstone’ or artwork label, typically found in gallery or museum exhibitions (one aspect of my job at the Vancouver Art Gallery was to produce such labels). This grave cover thus lists the artist’s name, biographical information, title, media, and date of the work. After its installation at the cemetery, the stone was photographed from the same perspective as the original photograph of the excavation. This photograph will be included in future presentations of the project.</td>

<td>Thrust into the waters of Burrard Inlet, The Drop playfully invites the viewer to reflect on our relationship with this precious commodity of water, and by extension, on the history, complexity, and future of our waterfront.

The Drop pays homage to the element of water and the un-tameable forces of nature which are omnipresent in Vancouver.  The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.

Although the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.

The sculpture’s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.  Like an abstract, radiant-blue ship’s figurehead, it marks the interface between land and water, between nature and technology.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">The Drop</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Thrust into the waters of Burrard Inlet, The Drop playfully invites the viewer to reflect on our relationship with this precious commodity of water, and by extension, on the history, complexity, and future of our waterfront.

The Drop pays homage to the element of water and the un-tameable forces of nature which are omnipresent in Vancouver.  The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.

Although the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.

The sculpture’s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.  Like an abstract, radiant-blue ship’s figurehead, it marks the interface between land and water, between nature and technology.</SimpleData>

<td>Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.</td>

The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.

And the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with gliders… Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.

<td>Beneath a long, dark Canadian winter, Vancouver will be a hive of activity during the 2010 Olympic Games. As a way of brightening the nights, adding to the sense of excitement and making the City visually remarkable, we developed three artistic lighting schemes for the City’s downtown core and Cambie Street.

Fireworks Boulevard, a series of sequenced LED fireworks, chases down Cambie Street, transforming it into a grand entrance boulevard to the City. Vivid and unequivocally joyful, one can imagine watching the street lighting against a sky filled with actual fireworks.

In Yaletown, these cool-toned LED rain barrels will be complemented by a series of warm coloured flickering LED flames. The flames atop the lampposts will bring a touch of the Olympic Torch from BC Place Stadium, where it will be housed, outside to the city streets. Flickering candle-like flames will also provide a sense of warmth for the cold winter evenings and recall a time when gaslight was used to illuminate the streets of Yaletown.</td>

Both are recognized for site-specific works that incorporate a variety of mediums and contrasting materials to animate environments. For this Vancouver installation – and their first collaboration - the duo developed decorative, playful street lighting elements to provide a sense of place for visitors.

Fireworks Boulevard is a series of LED fireworks between King Edward and 12th on Cambie Street. Rain Barrels , in Yaletown, on Mainland Street, are a series of cool blue animated LED barrels in which the lights sequence similar to a Vancouver rainfall. Flames, is a set of candle-like LED lights.</td>

The flames atop the lampposts will bring a touch of the Olympic Torch from BC Place Stadium, where it will be housed, outside to the city streets. Flickering candle-like flames will also provide a sense of warmth for the cold winter evenings and recall a time when gaslight was used to illuminate the streets of Yaletown.</SimpleData>

<SimpleData name="descriptionofwork">Canadian artists Adrian Göllner and Pierre Poussin created three artistic lighting schemes for the Cambie Street corridor and Yaletown. Both are recognized for site-specific works that incorporate a variety of mediums and contrasting materials to animate environments. For this Vancouver installation – and their first collaboration - the duo developed decorative, playful street lighting elements to provide a sense of place for visitors.

Fireworks Boulevard is a series of LED fireworks between King Edward and 12th on Cambie Street. Rain Barrels , in Yaletown, on Mainland Street, are a series of cool blue animated LED barrels in which the lights sequence similar to a Vancouver rainfall. Flames, is a set of candle-like LED lights.</SimpleData>

<td>Surface is a live documentary of the underwater life of False Creek, transmitted from a camera mounted under an aquabus (a small commuter ferry). The submerged camera feeds streaming video 24 hours/day directly to www.surfacer.ca and to a TV monitor mounted inside the boat, which people can watch while riding the ferry. The live footage can also be seen on screens at various locations on Granville Island. 

The live stream functions as an abstract mix of colours and impressions, until crustaceans or fish swim by. After dusk, Surface takes on a more intimate world, when tiny crustaceans, larval animals and eels can be seen. During the term of its installation, Vancouver artist Fiona Bowie hopes to track the health of False Creek’s marine life as evidence of our collective footprint.</td>

<td>Flow is Vancouver&#39;s first photo/media-based permanent public art work. A daily Flow concept developed by Fiona Bowie and Sidney Fels, based on using various components, such as time of day and weather, partially influences the behaviour of how images in the work appear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels with Morgan Hibbert allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they are simultaneously present with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they&#39;re part of a larger narrative. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over a number of years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material, switch glass. As viewers come close to the image, the switch glass causes portions of the imagery to disappear as the surface of the glass panels &#39;switch&#39; from translucent to clear.  The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream-like or hallucinatory quality. Because the projection system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow&#39;s dynamic glass projection surface creates viewing portals, framing details of the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street (these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby are able to view activity going on inside the building.

<td>A community-based mural involving numerous experienced mural painters working with the local community, this mural was designed to visually engage pedestrians, cyclists and drivers along the McLean Bike route in and out of the city. For this reason, we collectively decided on a theme of migration, most specifically, the daily migration of crows. The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. 
Artistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.

In coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. 
In all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties. A set of videos were made of the process, as well as an extensive photo-documentation.</td>

<td>Thauberger&#39;s Ecce Homo is a dramatic photomural inspired by classical painting, most specifically, the 1793 painting Death of Marat by Jacque-Louis David, and also by the locally based forensic drama Da Vinci&#39;s Inquest and the association with local politics through its source in the life of former Vancouver Chief Coroner and Mayor (now Senator) Larry Campbell. The image conflates these two sources in an exquisitely produced larger-then-life dramatic image. The David painting featured the death of a writer deeply involved in the politics of the French revolution. This association between art and politics, real life and representation, is at the heart of the work.

The image for the Vancouver City Centre Station features well-known Canadian actor Nicholas Campbell, who played the title role in Chris Haddock&#39;s television series Da Vinci&#39;s Inquest and Da Vinci City Hall. The actor is horizontally positioned on an autopsy table. His right hand is raised as though in an afterthought - caught between life and death, real life and drama, form and reflection. The title Ecce Homo &mdash; behold the man &mdash; draws on a rich history of references from the condemnation of Christ to many other contexts including the title of Nietzsche&#39;s autobiography. The project is an allegory of the relationship of art, life and politics that encompasses multiple associations.</td>

Functioning as a sign on the building, the letters are rendered in a font designed by the artists which references the motif of a formal trellis structure employing trompe l'oeil techniques to create illusory depth and space.

<td>For close to a century, Canada's residential school system worked to fragment and eradicate the cultures of its indigenous nations. While the legacy of this violence has resisted its suppression, it is only in recent memory that the trauma of this history has become public discussion. It is through this lens that watching Richard C. Bocking's 1967 documentary Seraphine: Her Own Story Told by Seraphine Ned draws one into a web of uncertainty. Seraphine was produced for the CBC Vancouver's Camera West series and was screened on September 17, 1969. The film tells the story of Seraphine Ned, journeying from the segregation of residential schools into a career in public nursing.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">Her Story</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">For close to a century, Canada's residential school system worked to fragment and eradicate the cultures of its indigenous nations. While the legacy of this violence has resisted its suppression, it is only in recent memory that the trauma of this history has become public discussion. It is through this lens that watching Richard C. Bocking's 1967 documentary Seraphine: Her Own Story Told by Seraphine Ned draws one into a web of uncertainty. Seraphine was produced for the CBC Vancouver's Camera West series and was screened on September 17, 1969. The film tells the story of Seraphine Ned, journeying from the segregation of residential schools into a career in public nursing.</SimpleData>

<td>Giants Among Us is my response to the role of reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Settlers to this land. Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.

The image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. 

The second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her “Skwanee.” She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.

The third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.

The final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.

Although I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice. I look to our stories for lessons on how to overcome the giants in our path.</td>

<td>“Fusion” is an artwork that marries mediums and cultures…as well as legends.  It also, metaphorically, fuses natural imagery with modern methods.

The sculpture is contemporary yet unmistakably Salish.  As this development sits in traditional Musqueam territory and is close to the banks of the Fraser River, my conceptual art piece is based on the theme of “people of the Grass” as well as the “Salmon People” which is uniquely Musqueam.  The human element within the salmon has universal appeal that symbolically relates to all peoples.  The faces are revealed with traditional Salish elements.  Overall, the forms represent a living thriving culture and our historical legacy; as well as this unique community today…giving a sense of place and a landmark that respects the past, present and future.</td>

<td>This sculpture sits in the heart of Marpole, one of Vancouver’s oldest residential neighbourhoods; it also sits on traditional Musqueam territory.  The Musqueam people have lived on their traditional territory – the land and waters now known as the lower mainland of BC encompassing the greater Vancouver region – for several thousands of years.  One of Musqueam’s most sacred sites, the Great Fraser Midden, is located just south of this site.

The sculpture was conceived by the artist to acknowledge this rich cultural history, the history of the Coast Salish people, and to (re)introduce the residents of this community to their neighbour ~ the Musqueam people.

The 14’ high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River.</td>

<td>"Land is usually depicted as steady and stable, Sea as unpredictable, and Sky as free spirited." ​Our account of Land and Sea is a contemporary tale about our homeland. Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle’s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements. Only when we see the whole picture together will the circle be complete. Our home is to inspire people to look closer in order to understand the subtleties and multitude of factors involved in our world.</td>

<td>Elizabeth Zvonar conjures romantic sentiment and melancholic undertones in "The Experience", a bleached-out collage boldly positioned in downtown Vancouver during the dreary months of winter. Combining materials and strategies used in advertising, the site-specific public artwork draws tangential connections between thoughtful inquiry and advertorial amusement. A pair of sunglasses from a 1970s fashion magazine is placed in the foreground of a celestial landscape from Mars, creating a scene that reads like a postcard from the future. In "The Experience", Zvonar continues her practice of appropriating imagery from various sources including advertising, contemporary fashion photography and counterculture media. She amplifies the digital design of her hand-cut collage by dramatically increasing its scale and incorporating lighting effects to produce an environment that shifts from a space of entertainment to one of examination.</td>

<td>RIPPLES is a series of three screen-based animations created using a digital moiré technique. This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moiré. Alongside the use of digital moiré, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies. The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer’s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion. Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits. The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye. The display becomes a reflecting pool; a space of contemplation on the presence and nature of screen technology.</td>

<td>The images play off of and provoke, engage and express the position that we find ourselves in, at this time and place. Some of the themes/considerations of the specific images in numbered order corresponding to the images are:Sightlines/site-lines, from where do we perceive the city of Vancouver, what vantage/dis-advantage point(s). What layers are we missing directly in front of us. / And after this, what piles of things, our appliances for living, what is needed then discarded into the dump, our archive of things. / What residue remains, detritus/artifacts/culture, what have we covered up, destroyed, demolished or buried. /We make piles of our past and then cart them away, out of sight. / The pastoral is present, somewhere in our minds eye, bracketed by the realities of our moment, the circumstances of our place. / Celestial views etched into a red car hood seen at night. In the suburban/urban setting, in a neighbourhood of homes on top of Coast Salish (Musqueam/ Squamish/Tsleil-Waututh) land at or near sən’a?qw/Sen’ákw (Kitsalano reduced from August Jack Xats'alanexw/Khahtsahlano). The ability of the abstract to bring one further into the scene, the setting, the night sky. / Canada’s institutional cultural genocide, the repression, the oppression of the physical space on indigenous children and indigenous life, the residential school buildings’ constructed architecture of trauma. / Survivors’ forms, the art that carries, CW’s carving area, creations out of the substance of life. / Nature’s forms, the beaver’s work/mark, the inspiration, the analogy used, crossing histories. / The inversely sanctified aquarium tank, attempting to preserve and replicate the ‘natural’ setting in a fluorescent lit steel box. Nature does persist, we are part of it, strangely. / The humans’ markings, what tools we need, remnants/reminiscent of our settler history. / A found pile of dead Yellow Jacket wasps tenacious, their ‘industrialness’ rivals the bees’ and is even more viscous in its defence, the nearness of life and death, the corpse in our presence and attraction/fear of the dangers of what may be found. / We come from water, from once was us and them as one there, now etched into rocks where water once was. / Artifice representing other pasts, the internment of others, the waste, the defilement, the failure of ‘knowledge’. / How do we position ourselves in relation to the natural, what is our place.. The dolphins swim by, in a pod, weaving as one, the young human hand reaches out, trying to grasp what she is missing or to bond and show affection for something that is so close to us at times and at other times so distant. / Coastal nature’s beauty and wonder. As if we could ever imitate these colours and forms. Real life playing out, evolution on display. / Our de-evolution, global consumerism, consuming the world, all enveloped in its path, here and elsewheres. Coastal cities linked by commerce, succumbing to history. / And the gaze, wonderment, looking, into and beyond where we are in present histories, connecting us. / The construction of the coastal city, metaphorically and literally, the building over of histories and the continuation of colonial/historical trajectories. The imposition of technology/machinery over the ‘natural’/nature and the juxapositions that illustrate this. The water connecting us all.My intent with this work is to present images that are incidentally seen or viewed in purpose, passed by and through on a daily basis, drawing-in, and tracing relationships, enabling viewers to engage in reflection and consideration of the layers of the present and of histories that we are emersed in, swimming in, in this place called home. A history of the present.</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">The images play off of and provoke, engage and express the position that we find ourselves in, at this time and place. Some of the themes/considerations of the specific images in numbered order corresponding to the images are:Sightlines/site-lines, from where do we perceive the city of Vancouver, what vantage/dis-advantage point(s). What layers are we missing directly in front of us. / And after this, what piles of things, our appliances for living, what is needed then discarded into the dump, our archive of things. / What residue remains, detritus/artifacts/culture, what have we covered up, destroyed, demolished or buried. /We make piles of our past and then cart them away, out of sight. / The pastoral is present, somewhere in our minds eye, bracketed by the realities of our moment, the circumstances of our place. / Celestial views etched into a red car hood seen at night. In the suburban/urban setting, in a neighbourhood of homes on top of Coast Salish (Musqueam/ Squamish/Tsleil-Waututh) land at or near sən’a?qw/Sen’ákw (Kitsalano reduced from August Jack Xats'alanexw/Khahtsahlano). The ability of the abstract to bring one further into the scene, the setting, the night sky. / Canada’s institutional cultural genocide, the repression, the oppression of the physical space on indigenous children and indigenous life, the residential school buildings’ constructed architecture of trauma. / Survivors’ forms, the art that carries, CW’s carving area, creations out of the substance of life. / Nature’s forms, the beaver’s work/mark, the inspiration, the analogy used, crossing histories. / The inversely sanctified aquarium tank, attempting to preserve and replicate the ‘natural’ setting in a fluorescent lit steel box. Nature does persist, we are part of it, strangely. / The humans’ markings, what tools we need, remnants/reminiscent of our settler history. / A found pile of dead Yellow Jacket wasps tenacious, their ‘industrialness’ rivals the bees’ and is even more viscous in its defence, the nearness of life and death, the corpse in our presence and attraction/fear of the dangers of what may be found. / We come from water, from once was us and them as one there, now etched into rocks where water once was. / Artifice representing other pasts, the internment of others, the waste, the defilement, the failure of ‘knowledge’. / How do we position ourselves in relation to the natural, what is our place.. The dolphins swim by, in a pod, weaving as one, the young human hand reaches out, trying to grasp what she is missing or to bond and show affection for something that is so close to us at times and at other times so distant. / Coastal nature’s beauty and wonder. As if we could ever imitate these colours and forms. Real life playing out, evolution on display. / Our de-evolution, global consumerism, consuming the world, all enveloped in its path, here and elsewheres. Coastal cities linked by commerce, succumbing to history. / And the gaze, wonderment, looking, into and beyond where we are in present histories, connecting us. / The construction of the coastal city, metaphorically and literally, the building over of histories and the continuation of colonial/historical trajectories. The imposition of technology/machinery over the ‘natural’/nature and the juxapositions that illustrate this. The water connecting us all.My intent with this work is to present images that are incidentally seen or viewed in purpose, passed by and through on a daily basis, drawing-in, and tracing relationships, enabling viewers to engage in reflection and consideration of the layers of the present and of histories that we are emersed in, swimming in, in this place called home. A history of the present.</SimpleData>

<td>The Journey is a public art series created for installation in Vancouver’s transit ad spaces for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City. The five works in this series take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered self-help and new-age book covers. Both the myth and experience of Vancouver as a ‘Coastal City’ connect with overarching ideas in Mallett’s practice; this new series of images is akin to her ongoing series Personhood, which pulls its imagery from covers of self-improvement texts popular in the ‘70s and ‘80s exploring the terrain of quasi-mysticism, personal empowerment, and commodity culture. Taking a form reminiscent of outdated posters, these works isolate elliptical statements on self-improvement and the nature of being in self-referential and critical ways. The Journey references what the artist describes as a ‘West Coast New-Age’ culture, with a specific focus on ideas of travel, movement, and transition. These works play with themes of ‘transit’ and the ‘Coastal City’ in direct response to the situation of the work in the transit shelter ad spaces around Vancouver, through alluding to this regionally specific ‘new-age’ sensibility as well as the commonly used metaphor of ‘the journey’ in self-help literature.The artist would like to thank Nigel Lew and Emiliano Sepulveda for their assistance in making this work.</td>

The relation between the world as we see it and the world as we understand it to be is all wrapped up in abstraction, the act of emphasizing some details in order to dispense with others. My artistic interest in abstraction and computation is an interest in the world as it is versus the world as we read into and conceptualize it. As our gaze peers off into the distance, imagination takes over reality… is site-specific public artwork that uses a photographic image of the surrounding site as raw material. The bottom of the image shows this imperfect photographic illusion, a proxy of objective reality, that becomes increasingly abstracted towards the top. The abstraction is a proxy for the constructive powers of imagination and is the result of a machine learning process that rearranges colour values according to their similarity. The imaginary structure presented in this image is both an emergent composition and an exposition of the implicit structure of reality. The image is a representation of place (as a physical location at the site of installation) and non-place (as an ambiguous and emerging structure under constant renewal). The viewer’s experience of the tension between ambiguity and reality mirrors the mind’s constant attempt to bridge experience and truth.</td>

<td>WHERENESS pays reverence to the eternal land by connecting the past to a present which is continually unfolding. A glacial boulder was selected from the earth at the project site, and six replica ‘boulders’ were cast from aluminum. WHERENESS provides a tactile link and landmark between the area’s geological past and its current situation. It is a visual puzzle to be examined and contemplated ‘in the round.’ WHERENESS acknowledges an ancient human practice of piling rocks at certain points along pathways to guide travelers. This 20’ tall column of boulders creates a new ‘point along the way’ for an emerging neighbourhood on the Cambie corridor in Vancouver.</td>

<td>Vancouver artist Khan Lee’s Red, Green and Blue is a sculptural installation that uses filtered light to animate nature. Drawing on broad references of horizon lines and landscape art, Lee enables passers-by to visualize the wind.Building on a sense of theatricality, Lee’s installation acts as an elaborate set composed of three-dimensional objects that cast larger-than-life shadows againstan enormous backdrop. Red, Green and Blue draws viewers into the intersections of artifice and nature with an abundant field of transparent cones fabricated from sheets of hand-folded plastic film. It is both painting and sculpture, using light filtered hrough red, green and blue lighting gels to project an immersive field of coloured, grass-like forms on the architecture of Offsite.Although an oasis literally refers to the greenery within a desert, it also describes a peaceful location or imagined place where one might escape the rigours of everyday life. Lee’s oasis unfolds into an array of colourful and contemplative possibilities that break up the monotony of grey surroundings.</td>

<td>Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.</td>

<td>ARTIST STATEMENT

I consider the space of painting (verb and noun) as a reflective space that engages cultural, material and personal experience. I work with painting as a process of thought. I believe that the physicality of the work and its indexicality of painted marks and gestures (subtle touches, rough scumbles, offhanded smears and studied glazes, etc.) vicariously open this exploratory thinking to an audience.

I am interested in the physiology of perception and how it is personally and culturally codified. My work considers how the world is realized through pictures: that how we picture the world (and how we are taught to picture the world) is how the world becomes. And I consider that if the resolution of a painting-object can be delayed and the process of perception is held open, a maker/viewer may discover agency there. For me the experience of making and looking at the painted object are intimately aligned with the scenes and experiences that I represent. This is a productive alignment. I confuse and equate the space of painting with the space of the world.

ARTWORK STATEMENT

The painted image for this work is a view through trees (on the border of urban and &lsquo;natural&rsquo; spaces) of Burrard Inlet at the start of səli̓ lw̓ ət (Indian Arm). It is seen from an imaginary vantage point: a view that doesn&rsquo;t exist. It is either dusk or dawn and so is unfixed in time as well as place.

This work is intended to provide space for reflection, outside of work and daily tasks: an interstitial moment to get lost in. The painting is dramatically enlarged and backlit. Its installation on the building&rsquo;s soffit is parallel to the ground. The final scale, glow and placement add to a sense of disorientation, offering an hallucinatory respite from the everyday.</td>

<td>The landmark at the corner of Cornwall and Burrard is comprised of a 16-foor long horizontal cedar log, a 7-foot high carved cedar log sculpture depicting scenes of the community past and present, and 16 granite and sandstone boulders, weighing up to 7 tons. The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan. The sign is an initiative of the Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce. (Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce, Dedication of the Welcome to Kitsilano Sign and Sculpture, June 20, 1998)</td>

The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of “all persons of Japanese racial origins,” from the west coast “protected area” of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled “enemy aliens,” were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners’ consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children’s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men’s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process. This image portrays the interior of the Livestock Building, with bedsheets dividing the living quarters. The thermal photograph suggests a way of seeing what is no longer obvious or visible to us today.</td>

<td>My vision for Fraser Commons was a pair of bronze sculptures. Mother and Child focuses on the idea of the family and is sited at the heart of the new development in the public park adjacent to the new daycare centre. This pair of sculptures hopes to foster through its biomorphic shapes, tactile material and series of openings, social and physical activity by encouraging children, teens and adults to interact with the work. The proposed work echoes the Fraser Commons&rsquo; ambition to create a family friendly and calm inviting space from which to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Often regarded as the father of modern British sculpture, Henry Moore and his longtime friend, colleague and fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth have been, time and again, a source of inspiration for my artistic work. In this instance, Mother and Child draws upon the artists&rsquo; use of abstraction of human and natural forms along with the recurring motif of the family. Like the work of Moore and Hepworth, the sculptures will be situated within the green space of the park and will act as a frame for the landscape.

Mother and Child is equally influenced by the post war &lsquo;play sculptures&rsquo; of British sculptor John Bridgeman (1916 &ndash; 2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon M&ouml;ller-Nielsen (1915 &ndash; 1959). Bridgeman and M&ouml;ller-Nielsen&rsquo;s play-sculpture hybrids are models for the work&rsquo;s sense of playfulness and will help to animate the space and humanize the architectural design of the new Fraser Commons.

The choice of traditional cast bronze is a nod to the works of these modernist masters, but is also motivated by my desire to encourage physical interaction, touching and movement through the works on the part of the viewer whose contact contributes to its changing patina. The sculpture&rsquo;s blue finish is informed by my childhood memories of the old Blue Boy Motel Hotel formerly located on the site. The colour provides something of an historical trace of the distinctive &lsquo;Wosk&rsquo; blue tiles which were a part of the Vancouver landscape for so long. The blue colour will also act as a beautiful counterpoint to the copper tones that are seen throughout Fraser Commons.

Mother and Child will invite interaction at the ground level of the community but will also have visual appeal when viewed from above. In its simplicity, the work will provide a focal point for the busy new hub of the Sunset community.</td>

<td>Deanna Bowen’s artistic practice concerns itself with histories of Black experience in Canada and the US. Her focus is the “dark matter” in our midst: people and events that remain just below the threshold of visibility, not because they are impossible to find but because they are difficult for the majority culture to acknowledge due to the systematized racism they expose. Mining overlooked archives, she asks difficult questions about who records history. She reactivates historic documents through a process of extraction, translation and enlargement, and then reinserts this material back into public consciousness in a new form. Over the past two years, Bowen has undertaken exhaustive research in Vancouver to trace a series of intertwined figures who formed an integral part of this city’s Black entertainment community from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s. She mapped a constellation of nightclubs, theatres and hotels where they gathered— many of which have been erased from the city’s physical fabric and its collective memory, but exist as traces in the archives. Her aim is to bring a more complex Black community into visibility, and to posit a powerful counterpoint to common narratives that oversimplify the city’s Black presence by containing it within the spatial, economic and temporal confines of Hogan’s Alley. Night Prowl captures part of a frame of filmed footage accompanying CBC reportage about Vancouver’s ethnically diverse east end nightclubs that aired on October 14, 1959. Racially-motivated anxieties around such nightclubs—and the neighbourhoods in which they were situated—would fuel the calls for urban renewal that would dramatically displace Black communities in the coming decades. The image, which depicts the neon marquee of a now-forgotten dance club after dark, is interrupted by a series of circular voids: visible fragments of batch numbers punched through the cellulose film at its time of manufacture. The holes are a banal artifact found at the end of any film reel. For Bowen, however, the ruptured cellulose reminds us of film’s fragile materiality, compromises its visual seamlessness and undermines our ability to trust photography’s seductive promise of “truth.” Considered this way, even blemished and seemingly insignificant documents can be rich repositories for unintended readings, and for questioning who has been charged with writing our histories, and why.Kimberly Phillips, Curator, Contemporary Gallery</td>

But focusing only on the pain of this tragedy isn’t telling the complete story. Instead, I’ve become driven by how strongly the voices of triumph and hope still ring out from underneath the loss.With this piece I wish to highlight a vibrant, joyful perspective: one of hope and a future built from past remnants.Motifs of music and laughter emerge throughout the stories and memories I have encountered. The passion for rebuilding, of bringing back to Vancouver what has been lost, is particularly moving. This tribute explores growth and rebirth - our youth rediscovering their roots and communing with their forebears through whatever means available. Hogan’s Alley is a precious piece of history in dire need of remembrance and revival.

<td>Coast Salish Artist, a self-portrait by the Musqueam and Coast Salish artist and carver Chrystal Sparrow, presented on twenty transit-shelter posters throughout the city from October 5 to November 1, 2020. This is a photograph of the artist adorned in Native American regalia, a reflection on famous 19th century Native American Indian portraits that presented subjects in beadwork, traditional adornments, and fabrics from that time.Sparrow explains: “I have found that adding these Native American regalia images to my self-portraits has delivered a significant connection to the idea of historical ceremonies practiced by wearing regalia. I also felt a sense of nobility, respect, and inspiration when a chief's regalia covered a part of my body. I also used images of salmon leather, Coast Salish formlines, berries, patterns and textures. My interest to use self-portraits has become a study of traditional art and regalia to be manifested in my work; with the intent to discover more about my Coast Salish, Cree and Shuswap art practices."</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Coast Salish Artist, a self-portrait by the Musqueam and Coast Salish artist and carver Chrystal Sparrow, presented on twenty transit-shelter posters throughout the city from October 5 to November 1, 2020. This is a photograph of the artist adorned in Native American regalia, a reflection on famous 19th century Native American Indian portraits that presented subjects in beadwork, traditional adornments, and fabrics from that time.Sparrow explains: “I have found that adding these Native American regalia images to my self-portraits has delivered a significant connection to the idea of historical ceremonies practiced by wearing regalia. I also felt a sense of nobility, respect, and inspiration when a chief's regalia covered a part of my body. I also used images of salmon leather, Coast Salish formlines, berries, patterns and textures. My interest to use self-portraits has become a study of traditional art and regalia to be manifested in my work; with the intent to discover more about my Coast Salish, Cree and Shuswap art practices."</SimpleData>

<td>Weekend Chime is a sound installation that plays notes based on the chorus of Loverboy&rsquo;s iconic song, Working for the Weekend every Friday at 5 p.m., to signal the end of the traditional work week and the beginning of the weekend. More specifically, the chime sounds the two-note melody used by singer Mike Reno while singing the word &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; in the chorus that gives the song its title. The artwork explores themes of class, labour struggles and the versatility of pop music.

Although the lyrics seem to loosely depict a kind of social-recreational interaction, the artist has interpreted the song as an unofficial sing-along anthem for the weekend itself and for working people. The artist Brady Cranfield says &ldquo;I see a parallel between the way everyday people use, reuse, remake and occupy that space and the way that we use, reuse, remake and occupy pop songs. Weekend Chime will hopefully act as a reminder that we&rsquo;re all workers, the true producers of value in the world.&rdquo;

<td>Speaker A is a permanent sound installation that creates impact with the precise manipulation of directional sound as an auditory, &lsquo;sculptural&rsquo; presence. The work includes three distinct audio tracks, installed at specific locations within the plaza. Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &ldquo;column&rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.

The audio tracks are a series of collaborative texts/stories, gleaned from fourteen writers from around the city that, when taken together, weave narratives that define lives lived in proximity: restlessness and care. Each speaker reveals a randomized program of short narratives that span past, present and future: the work invites listeners to explore the ideas of Restless Futures (Speaker A), Speculative Pasts (Speaker B) and Instructions for Care in the present (Speaker C). Owing to programming by Remy Siu and responsive sound design by Antoine B&eacute;dard, each speaker retains a constantly shifting presence; each listener experiences a unique sequence of narrative and sound.

The narratives are drawn from emerging and established writers, including Lorna Brown, Lili Robinson, Amber Dawn, Aryo Khakpour, James Long, Maiko Yamamoto, Whess Harman, Amiel Gladstone, Jus-tine A. Chambers, Cease Wyss, Vanessa Kwan, Hiromi Goto, Faith Sparrow-Crawford, and Tim Carlson.

The use of sound relates to the artist team&rsquo;s interest in creating experiences in public space that draw attention to ideas, histories and subjectivities that lie beneath the surface of the city: quite literally the things we can&rsquo;t see. Each sound work is part of a greater narrative, each text building on a compo-sition that cannot be encompassed in one person&rsquo;s experience alone. The work is expected to evolve as a presence at the site over time, to stand as both a record of this place, in this moment&mdash;many of the narratives were written in 2020, in the midst of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in many ways reflect that unprecedented experience&mdash;while looking forward and back with speculation, anxiety and hope.</td>

<SimpleData name="descriptionofwork">Speaker A is a permanent sound installation that creates impact with the precise manipulation of directional sound as an auditory, &amp;lsquo;sculptural&amp;rsquo; presence. The work includes three distinct audio tracks, installed at specific locations within the plaza. Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &amp;ldquo;column&amp;rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.

Speaker A was commissioned by Create Urban Development Corporation as part of their participation in the City of Vancouver&amp;#39;s Public Art Program for Private Development.</SimpleData>

<td>The Collective Agency Project is a public art project that began in February 2020. The project provided a group of older adults with a unique opportunity to work with a team of established artists over two years to develop critical and technical skills and produce a socially engaged, photo-based public artwork. Lead artists for the project are Christos Dikeakos and Birthe Piontek, with support from artists Henri Robideau and Barrie Jones.

Group participants investigated the potential of photography and photo-based media via a series of workshops. The project was open to experimentation, interaction, growth, and collaboration as the group evolved and developed their art practices.

ABOUT THE GROUP

The group formed at the Hillcrest Community Centre, and through the COVID-19 pandemic, adapted to meeting online, with a core of nine dedicated participants.

The group includes:


\tOonagh Berry
\tAnn Daskal
\tAnnemarie Etsell
\tVerena Foxx
\tGreg Helem
\tSchula Leonard
\tKeith Martin
\tMickey McCaffrey
\tJudith Snider


The Collective Agency Project is coordinated by Ann Pollock and produced by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program in fulfillment of the public art requirement for Opal by element, and in partnership with Arts &amp; Health: Healthy Aging Through the Arts, Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation.</td>

<td>Paul de Guzman&rsquo;s series of performances titled laro na tayo - let&#39;s play are based on the childhood game &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; (kick) played throughout the Philippines. A precursor to hacky sack, the game also predates the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in the 16th century, and is played with a shuttlecock-like object made from a &quot;tingga&quot; (metal washer) wrapped in straw, cloth, or both. Guzman&rsquo;s nomadic and temporary performances explored the Filipino-Canadian experience, and the complexities of migration, colonization, and multiculturalism.  

&ldquo;laro na tayo &ndash; let&#39;s play&rdquo; is part performance, social practice and residual installation. The project channels the nomadic and temporary as a post-colonial strategy referencing the Filipino-Canadian experience. &ldquo;laro&rdquo; confronts the complexities of migration, colonization, settlement and multi-culturalism through the didactics of a childhood game and the history it represents.

&ldquo;laro&rdquo; begins and ends with the cherished childhood memory of play. Once the national sport of the Philippines, the game of &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; (meaning &ldquo;kick&rdquo;) is ubiquitous in the playgrounds of elementary schools. Its origin predates the Spanish colonization of the 16th century and is played with a shuttlecock-like object made from a &quot;tingga&quot; (metal washer) wrapped in plastic and paper straw. A precursor to hacky-sack, &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; is often played with others. Fashioned in multi-coloured straw wrapped around a metal washer, the &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; game token is crafted in unlimited quantities. The performance begins with the artist arriving with a collection of &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; game tokens. After a brief display, the artist begins to play. A skilled player can kick the &ldquo;sipa&rdquo; many consecutive times until eventually landing on the ground. The tokens remain where they land and another token is played with.

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">laro na tayo - let's play</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Paul de Guzman&amp;rsquo;s series of performances titled laro na tayo - let&amp;#39;s play are based on the childhood game &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; (kick) played throughout the Philippines. A precursor to hacky sack, the game also predates the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in the 16th century, and is played with a shuttlecock-like object made from a &amp;quot;tingga&amp;quot; (metal washer) wrapped in straw, cloth, or both. Guzman&amp;rsquo;s nomadic and temporary performances explored the Filipino-Canadian experience, and the complexities of migration, colonization, and multiculturalism.  

&amp;ldquo;laro na tayo &amp;ndash; let&amp;#39;s play&amp;rdquo; is part performance, social practice and residual installation. The project channels the nomadic and temporary as a post-colonial strategy referencing the Filipino-Canadian experience. &amp;ldquo;laro&amp;rdquo; confronts the complexities of migration, colonization, settlement and multi-culturalism through the didactics of a childhood game and the history it represents.

&amp;ldquo;laro&amp;rdquo; begins and ends with the cherished childhood memory of play. Once the national sport of the Philippines, the game of &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; (meaning &amp;ldquo;kick&amp;rdquo;) is ubiquitous in the playgrounds of elementary schools. Its origin predates the Spanish colonization of the 16th century and is played with a shuttlecock-like object made from a &amp;quot;tingga&amp;quot; (metal washer) wrapped in plastic and paper straw. A precursor to hacky-sack, &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; is often played with others. Fashioned in multi-coloured straw wrapped around a metal washer, the &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; game token is crafted in unlimited quantities. The performance begins with the artist arriving with a collection of &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; game tokens. After a brief display, the artist begins to play. A skilled player can kick the &amp;ldquo;sipa&amp;rdquo; many consecutive times until eventually landing on the ground. The tokens remain where they land and another token is played with. Light Filipino snacks and refreshments are offered to those wishing to stay. The audience is encouraged to watch, learn and participate in the game. When all the tokens have landed, the artist leaves the tokens behind for the audience to take. The event lasts about two hours.

<td>Home Edition shows the living room of artist Jeffery Chong&rsquo;s grandparents, staged as it was on July 2nd, 1964, when Jeffery&rsquo;s grandfather Ging Chong appeared on CBC&rsquo;s newscast, &ldquo;Home Edition&rdquo;. This public art shares the same title. Ging was working at a hotel near Chinatown and had just witnessed a crime. When the news crew arrived to cover the story, Ging was captured on film for several seconds. The family did not watch the news that evening, nor did they know that such footage existed. After the broadcast, the newsreel remained undiscovered in the CBC vault until Jeffery visited its archives decades later.

Jeffery&rsquo;s family research has been a long journey, chasing down documents and photographs to fill gaps not found in archives, and learning stories never shared by a silent generation. Inspired by this newsreel and the setting in which it would have been viewed, Jeffery researched photographs and interviewed family members to piece together how his grandparents&rsquo; living room appeared in 1964, and to learn about Ging, who died before Jeffery was born.

Most of the furniture and household items are original to this room. The reproduction paintings were acquired using coupons from supermarket purchases. On the mantle, containers that once held Chinese vegetables and distilled spirits are displayed as decoration. Tin juice cans, aluminum pie plates, and a fruit crate are reused for houseplants. These items reflect the working class life of Ging, who held many jobs trying to make ends meet.

The living room is of the Mid-Century Builder vernacular, a modern, inexpensive, mass-produced housing option for working class families in the Lower Mainland. The emergence of the style paralleled the rise of television&rsquo;s popularity. The furniture placement is focused on how the family planned time together around the television. The clock, a wedding gift to Jeffery&rsquo;s grandparents, indicates 6:45, the time Ging appeared on television. The television is on but nobody is watching, symbolizing this almost forgotten newsreel, and how the past is fragile if not recorded, or passed down.

Home Edition is the recreation of a time and a place, portraying Jeffery&rsquo;s family history, identity and values, and a reminder of how technology and the built environments of the past brought together families in a way that no longer exists.</td>

<td>The Dusk Meridian is a multimedia installation by the Vancouver&ndash; and Kelowna&ndash;based artist Keith Langergraber. Its principal features are scaled-down representations of two fire towers that are physically close but imaginatively separated: the real-life versions sit on either side of the border that divides Canada and the US at the southern boundary of E.C. Manning Provincial Park. The title refers to the moment in time between the setting of the sun and the onset of darkness and to the geographical location of this phenomenon, which endlessly traverses the rotating surface of the planet. It is also a nod to Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s The Blood Meridian, an apocalyptic neo-biblical novel set in the border between the US and Mexico. These references are reiterated in the phantasmagoric light projected onto the fire towers, the pool of water on which they sit and the wall behind them, evoking a transitional condition somewhere between the setting of the sun and the approach of a catastrophic wildfire. But while the warmth of this light might contrast with the overcast gloom of a Vancouver winter, it offers little in the way of easy comfort.

Langergraber&rsquo;s work serves as an allegory for crossing a point of no return: passing from light into darkness. Here, the devastation wrought by widespread wildfires&mdash;a force of nature unconstrained by abstractions like national borders&mdash;becomes the norm. The fire towers of The Dusk Meridian can be seen as silent witnesses to this transition, much like barometers measuring climactic change that has already arrived.

<SimpleData name="descriptionofwork">Pedestrian Protest is a temporary installation as part of the Offsite series and was on view from April 9, 2021 to October 11, 2021. 

Offsite is an outdoor public art space in the heart of the city. Presenting an innovative program of temporary projects, it is a site for local and international contemporary artists to exhibit works related to the surrounding urban context. Featured artists consider the site-specific potential of art within the public realm and respond to the changing social and cultural conditions of our contemporary world. New projects are installed in the spring and fall of each year.

Offsite is organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery and funded by the City of Vancouver through the Public Art Program.</SimpleData>

This series of unique prints combines the traditional printmaking processes of monotype, silkscreen, and stone lithography. Working loosely from satellite images of empty parking lots within the city of Vancouver and improvisational marks made during the printing process, these Vacant Lots portray both a timeline of activity and a pause. The prints recall feelings of isolation, confinement, and emptiness, similar to when the world seemed to pause in March of 2020. On the surface they are uninhabited but when viewed from above, they embody an organized togetherness and signal a presence within a field of absence.</td>

Spring Awakening includes four different repeating images (a frog, a wild rose, a salmonberry, and a bear) designed and framed using Coast Salish Design elements. Each of these figures are symbols of spring and fresh starts.

In Coast Salish culture, the new year begins when the frogs awaken and begin to sing. The bears are drawn in a way that reflects an old type of design language in Coast Salish work. The salmonberry is the first berry to come in the spring and brings colour to the environment, while wild roses that come a little bit later represent the beauty and fullness of spring and summer, and the full circle of these patterns.</td>

<td>Creator Take Us Home and Matriarchs in the Making presented on twenty transit-shelter posters throughout the city from August 14 - September 24, 2023.

&ldquo;We are people of oral history; our weavings are documents of our living culture. As weavers, we are taught that our weavings hold the knowledge, pass on teachings, affirm laws and are living documents of our history. Weavings also demonstrate community wealth and wellness by passing down these teachings through family lineage.&quot; Caitlin Aleck (Te-Awk-Tenaw)
 
Caitlin Aleck&rsquo;s 2 weavings relate to lineage, trauma and hope. Creator Take Us Home centres on the recent unearthing of the unmarked graves found on the grounds of Residential Schools across Canada. The piece is meant to reflect on the pain of the children, and the attempt by various levels of government to hide these widespread deaths. Elements of the weaving show the spirits of these young people travelling in their canoes, back to the creator.  As Caitlin states, &ldquo;While they are safe now, we continue to pray for them in ceremony and seek justice for their death.&rdquo;   
 
Matriarchs in the Making looks at the centrality of the matriarchal tradition in Caitlin&rsquo;s family and Nation.  This complex and colour-rich piece is dense with meaning and acts almost like a map or guide to the strong teachings and expectations in becoming a family matriarch. Each element, each colour and their individual placement in relation to each other speak about who watches over and cares though they are no longer here, who watches over and cares in our current day-to-day lives, and planting the seeds for future care by those just or not yet born.  Parts of this weaving are private or unknowable for Caitlin, but like so much of her work, her deep emotional response to both the act of weaving and the narratives they contain comes through in her compositions.</td>

Shain Niniwem Selapem Jackson&rsquo;s Eagle Woman is a digital drawing of an eagle matriarch dancing beneath a full copper moon.

Some have heartbeats, others made up only of memories spliced together with artful abandon. Some strands are copper and gold. Others are beautiful with ends frayed, tattered, or torn. She&rsquo;ll mend them with the fibres of her own frock despite being threadbare itself. Such is the sacrifice her art insists.&rdquo;</td>

<td>For this project, Lisa Lewis (Xwemilut) has woven regalia to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women, and the people working to end violence and bring justice under the banner of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two Spirit (MMIWG2S).

The final piece, titled, Always in our Hearts, is a photograph, showing the artist&rsquo;s niece wearing the woven regalia.

Lisa has this to say about the weavings: &ldquo;The dress is woven out of white wool to represent the purity of the souls of the murdered and missing women. The Salish red robe (worn over the dress) represents the blood that has been shed. The red colour also represents protection, and, in this way, the robe is meant to act as a safe keeping for the souls that have been taken from their people. The swan feathers that you see in this work are traditionally used to adorn our sacred ceremonial Skway Skway (Mask Dancers) regalia. As a Squamish Nation member, I have witnessed our families grieving their family member that have been missing or found murdered. My hope with this work is to bring attention to this issue.&rdquo;</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">For this project, Lisa Lewis (Xwemilut) has woven regalia to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women, and the people working to end violence and bring justice under the banner of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two Spirit (MMIWG2S).

The final piece, titled, Always in our Hearts, is a photograph, showing the artist&amp;rsquo;s niece wearing the woven regalia.

Lisa has this to say about the weavings: &amp;ldquo;The dress is woven out of white wool to represent the purity of the souls of the murdered and missing women. The Salish red robe (worn over the dress) represents the blood that has been shed. The red colour also represents protection, and, in this way, the robe is meant to act as a safe keeping for the souls that have been taken from their people. The swan feathers that you see in this work are traditionally used to adorn our sacred ceremonial Skway Skway (Mask Dancers) regalia. As a Squamish Nation member, I have witnessed our families grieving their family member that have been missing or found murdered. My hope with this work is to bring attention to this issue.&amp;rdquo;</SimpleData>

<td>Conceived in Germany while studying Gustave Courbet&rsquo;s series of Wave paintings, this work depicts the iconic Haribo gummy bear synonymous with German sweets tumbling through a turbulent wave. The image was born as a satirical nod to classical painting in a contemporary context; each gummy bear thrashes in the water ignoring formal perspective and logical depth, competing against each other to claim the forefront of the picture plane. The wave of green gummy bears swell as they culminate in the upper centre of the painting, conveying a sweeping dramatized formation of gummy bears against a stylized backdrop which references Courbet&rsquo;s realist seascape paintings.</td>

<td>This design originated from a painting I created in 2018. While unfolding a long-neglected canvas, I discovered intricate, beautiful creases that sparked my creativity. Intuitively, I began to paint these lines in green, developing an interesting design around them that resonates with my Indigenous roots. This pattern has been a significant part of my artistic journey for many years.

In 2020, I incorporated this design into a small fashion collection at the John Casablancas Institute, and I am excited to revisit it now as I expand into a new collection, which I hope to unveil soon. This design feels like a constant companion in my work, deeply connected to my identity, and I anticipate it will remain a part of my artistic expression for years to come.</td>

<td>With Lunar Pool, I wanted to capture the sensation of moving through watery liminal spaces. Watercolour painting naturally conveys this, with its transference of movement from hand to paper through pigmented water. The process is mysterious, with unexpected results. The combination of pigment, water and movement produce oneiric landscapes for the mind to wander through. In this instance I specifically wanted to recall a memory of swimming in the water off Jericho Beach at sunset. The diminishing rays of sunlight mixed with the sky, turning the water pink and blue. There was little distinction between water and air. My body dissolved in liquid colour and I felt a sense of belonging to something bigger and more universal, a sensation I strive to duplicate in my work.</td>

<td>The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPLʼs new nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ʻHead in holeʼ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.</td>

<td>Excavations is a composite image made from numerous archival photographs of Vancouver, with the earliest images dating back to the 1880s. Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver’s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city’s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver’s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist’s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver’s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">Excavations</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Excavations is a composite image made from numerous archival photographs of Vancouver, with the earliest images dating back to the 1880s. Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver’s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city’s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver’s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist’s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver’s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.</SimpleData>

<td>Inspired by water, waves and reflectiveness, this artwork is made up of a series of elegantly formed steel coated in chrome to achieve maximum reflectiveness and durability.

The elegant soft design of the curved forms cascading along the side of this development make up the overall shape of this public art piece. Throughout the development of the concept for this artwork the architectural design of the building, the proximity of the site to Waterfront Station, movement of the transient public and the historic elements of the neighbourhood have been carefully considered. The individual ripple shapes repeated in different scales in the artwork recall the stacked forms that are repeated vertically in the building, further highlighting the relationship between the ground plane, the landscape and the tower. A visually engaging piece, the artwork is thoughtfully designed to complement elements of the architecture of the building and its environment by harmoniously reflecting all surrounding elements, while maximizing permeability.

One of the most unique characteristics of our city is its surrounding waters. Water is essential to our existence and is wholly integrated into the lives and cultures of the Indigenous people who call this place home. The waterways surrounding this place also connect our region to the wider world. The history of the Waterfront Station and Gastown is a testament to this significance. Both in form and concept, the public artwork is reflective of the importance of water. The public artwork considers this natural gift as its central concept: the curvature of each shape alludes to the fluidity of water; the summation of all the shapes mimic water ripples; the mirroring material signifies water&rsquo;s reflectiveness.</td>

<td>According to the City of Vancouver’s Zero Waste 2040 statistics, residents, businesses and institutions threw away approximately 351,000 tonnes of garbage in 2015. Most of this “waste” is considered valuable resource material that could have been conserved, reused, recycled or composted instead of sent to the landfill or incinerator.New Delhi-based artist Asim Waqif’s site-specific installation at Offsite combines architecture with a strong contextual reference to contemporary urban design and the politics of urban waste management. Concerns of the environment and social responsibility weave through his work, and for this project Waqif has created an immersive architectural experience built out of materials collected from repurpose stores, the transfer station and landfill in the metro Vancouver area. The structure is assembled using timber, roofing, doors, window frames and sections of walls salvaged from recent demolitions and discarded from local residential and office building.Many of Waqif’s projects respond to an absence of a tactile, experiential aspect in contemporary art by establishing an element of interactivity inside a living, evolving, organic environment. At Offsite he installs mechanical and electronic panels into his maze-like structures to cultivate a multi-sensory experience with sound, light and movement. Visitors are encouraged to move through the installation, allowing them to activate the architecture. This is the artist’s first exhibition in Canada. - Courtesy of the Vancouver Art Gallery</td>

<td>&quot;身在唐人街/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN&quot; was Paul Wong&rsquo;s year-long artist residency at the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden that launched in Spring 2018. As part of the residency Wong created a series of artworks based on 700+ letters in Chinese sent by 90 writers to his mother Suk-Fong Wong, as well as other familial artefacts such as her Chinese medicine collection and photos. The artist also presented a series of programs and workshops with other artists and community members that included a pride event, artist talks, and a series of Chinese herb and medicine workshops.

The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &quot;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&quot; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in January 2019, and provided an account of China&rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century. The project was also documented through the website www.occupyingchinatown.com and will include a forthcoming publication. The city&rsquo;s Public Artwork &ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华&rdquo;now located in the alleyway of 475 Main street was also developed as part of Wong&rsquo;s 身在唐人街/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN project.</td>

As part of the residency Wong created a series of artworks based on 700+ letters in Chinese sent by 90 writers to his mother Suk-Fong Wong, as well as other familial artefacts such as her Chinese medicine collection and photos. The artist also presented a series of programs and workshops with other artists and community members that included a pride event, artist talks, and a series of Chinese herb and medicine workshops.

The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &amp;quot;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&amp;quot; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in January 2019, and provided an account of China&amp;rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&amp;rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&amp;rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century. The project was also documented through the website www.occupyingchinatown.com and will include a forthcoming publication. The city&amp;rsquo;s Public Artwork &amp;ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华&amp;rdquo;now located in the alleyway of 475 Main street was also developed as part of Wong&amp;rsquo;s 身在唐人街/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN project.</SimpleData>

<td>Over the course of a year, Vancouver-based artist Diyan Achjadi installed unique poster prints throughout the Main, Cambie, and Railtown neighbourhoods.

Over the course of that time the posters&mdash;hand-drawn and hand-printed through silkscreen, etching, lithography and polymer plate relief&mdash;accumulated and, left to the effects of the elements and actions of passersby, decayed, were transformed by graffiti and even removed.

Each of the banners is represented by an animal with importance within our culture that relates to each fire and illustrates our storytelling expertise. With the telling of this story, it is my aim to inspire Indigenous people to relearn our stories and teachings. I also wish to encourage discussion about reconciliation and protecting our earth.The Anishinaabeg are a proud and loving nation with a rich spiritual history. With these banners I’m bringing our stories to the library as a place of learning, to share our culture and knowledge with the west coast.Miigwech</td>

With the telling of this story, it is my aim to inspire Indigenous people to relearn our stories and teachings. I also wish to encourage discussion about reconciliation and protecting our earth.The Anishinaabeg are a proud and loving nation with a rich spiritual history. With these banners I’m bringing our stories to the library as a place of learning, to share our culture and knowledge with the west coast.Miigwech</SimpleData>

<td>“The Waters are Rising” shares the legend of “The Great Flood” into the public realm. We feel this Granville Bridge South location is ideal for sharing this legend.

The rope marks where the canoes were pulled up can still be seen on Mount Garibaldi and Mount Baker.This Coast Salish version shows a Thunderbird warning the people that the waters are rising. The Thunderbird resides in the sun. He is the Creator’s messenger. He helps the people on earth by warning them of oncoming events, usually of storms, but now he speaks of climate change. He is telling the people that the waters will keep rising until the people take full stewardship of precious Mother Earth. The Tyee Salmon are the knowledge keepers, and the Eulochon fish represent the learners. I have chosen this theme due to Indigenous concerns about stewardship of the land and waters, and the climate change crisis that is upon us.</td>

The public artworks at this site continue Falk’s devotion to keen observations of everyday objects, as well as her use of repetition, both of which have been central to her practice for over six decades.18 Pairs of Blue and White Running Shoes consists of a row of bronze shoes, cast in multiples from six new ceramic originals hand-sculpted by the artist and installed in pairs in an alternating pattern. The resulting row of shoes appears largely uniform in scale while displaying subtle differences from one pair to the next. In conceiving of this work, Falk revisited her ceramic projects of the 1960s and 70s, in particular, Eighteen Pairs of Red Shoes with Roses (1973) and Blue Running Shoes (1973). The shoes in 18 Pairs of Blue and White Running Shoes bear the traces of human presence while reflecting Falk’s career-long interest in utilizing elements of clothing to explore ideas of gender, ritual and status.</td>

These short poems, “I’d come get you, If you weren’t there, If you’d listen, I’d take you with me” positioned on mirror, reflect back at the reader with a tone particular to the reader’s owned lived experience – opening the text up to being interpreted as soothing sentiment or as maliciously overbearing.

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">reflections of poetic impositions are oscillating visual texts that take their charge from the collaborative imaginations of their readers. These short poems, “I’d come get you, If you weren’t there, If you’d listen, I’d take you with me” positioned on mirror, reflect back at the reader with a tone particular to the reader’s owned lived experience – opening the text up to being interpreted as soothing sentiment or as maliciously overbearing. Situated in a space dominated by advertising, they might also easily be mistaken for vague advertisements in a world foregrounded by capitalist desire.</SimpleData>

<td>In the grand scheme of Vancouver’s heritage, the neon period from 1925 to 1960 is perhaps the city’s most heralded example of its transition from gloomy sawmill town to vibrant metropolis. At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City’s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as “Spectaculars.”When McGavin’s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard’s bread, a “Spectacular” was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty’s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard’s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin’s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn’t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin’s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the “Spectacular” installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the “Spectacular” crew convened on the roof of McGavin’s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin’s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity’s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970’s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980’s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.</td>

<td>A Constellation of Remediation was a two-year long public art project that exhibited from November 2018 to 2021 that included the planting of Indigenous remediation gardens on vacant and untended lots on the unceded homelands of the xʷmə&theta;kʷəyə̓m (Musqueam), Sḵwxw&uacute;7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) nations.

The artists chose the constellation of sites based on the significant decolonization work near these locations through the work of the Native Education College (NEC), Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA), and the Wild Salmon Caravan residency and Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty.

The artists&rsquo; ongoing conversations with developers, City and Parks staff, and the public were an integral part of the project, a process that built connection while also shifting consciousness and awareness about bioremediation, and land-stewardship. 

UNYA Constellation Garden: Southwest corner of Hastings St &amp; Commercial Dr

The artists developed a remediation garden at a former gas station lot and home of an Urban Native Youth Association (UNYA) facility. Indigenous pollinator plants have been planted, creating a field of flowers that will continue to self-pollinate. In partnership with UNYA, the artists also held bioremediation workshops where they invited Indigenous youth to seed the soil and release butterflies on site.

Southwest corner of 5th Ave and Brunswick St

The artists removed invasive species at an over-looked triangular parklet owned by Aragon Properties Ltd a block away from Native Education College where they held workshops with students who made Indigenous wildflower seed bombs. 

Strathcona Park fieldhouse, 857 Malkin Ave

Pollinator plants with a relationship to salmon were planted in collaboration with Dawn Morrison and the Wild Salmon Caravan residency and Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty.</td>

<td>Signs in another language (ongoing series) presented on twenty digital screens throughout the city from December 6, 2021 - January 16, 2022. 

Drawing from BIPOC poetry, protest, and folklore, this ongoing text-based series examines immigrant narratives of loss, violence, and displacement. Pulling from personal experience moving throughout North America as a first-generation immigrant, the work connects notions of home and heritage to the undocumented labour and disposession experienced by people of color, individuals and families alike. In an era of gatekeeping national borders; rising violence directed towards  immigrants and refugees; and persisting conditions of systemic racial violence, the series juxtaposes national landmarks and marked lands with protest to confront the tenuous conditions of cultural assimilation and belonging, as well as propose measures of resistance and resilience.  

Informed by a lifetime of movement through the United States, Canada, and South Korea, Josephine Lee&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice is heavily informed by the psychic violence of cultural assimilation and naturalization through migration. Lee&rsquo;s sculptures, installations, and performances, intersect  narratives of dispossession and nationalism, making explicit how ideas of place are entangled within politics of citizenship and national identity. Within this framework, Lee&rsquo;s materials and forms  both signify and complicate overlapping identity formations, and notions of home and belonging. Lee&rsquo;s current research examines how technological transformations connect directly to systems of  political power, environmental degradation, and racial inequality. Further, she explores how these technologies may be configured toward BIPOC futures to enact cultural resilience and propose new orientations within bodies, ecologies, and architectural spaces.</td>

Indigenous Matriarchs is a multimedia work that uses poetry and photography to pay tribute to the artist Chrystal Sparrow&rsquo;s Coast Salish and Cree matriarchal lineage.

Sparrow&rsquo;s work was created to respect and honour the powerful women in her family and present Indigenous women as beautiful and moving. The names of the Coast Salish matriarchs she honours with this work are great-grandmother Rose Sparrow, from xʷmə&theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), and grandmother Esther Sparrow, from sh&iacute;sh&aacute;lh (Sechelt). The names of the Shuswap (Esk&#39;etemc) matriarchs are great-grandmother Angelina Wycotte, grandmother Elizabeth Wycotte, and Sparrow&rsquo;s own mother Marianne Sparrow.</td>

<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">Indigenous Matriarchs was exhibited on a billboard at Arbutus Street and West 12th Avenue from February 7 - May 1, 2022.

Indigenous Matriarchs is a multimedia work that uses poetry and photography to pay tribute to the artist Chrystal Sparrow&amp;rsquo;s Coast Salish and Cree matriarchal lineage.

Sparrow&amp;rsquo;s work was created to respect and honour the powerful women in her family and present Indigenous women as beautiful and moving. The names of the Coast Salish matriarchs she honours with this work are great-grandmother Rose Sparrow, from xʷmə&amp;theta;kʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), and grandmother Esther Sparrow, from sh&amp;iacute;sh&amp;aacute;lh (Sechelt). The names of the Shuswap (Esk&amp;#39;etemc) matriarchs are great-grandmother Angelina Wycotte, grandmother Elizabeth Wycotte, and Sparrow&amp;rsquo;s own mother Marianne Sparrow.</SimpleData>

<td>This artwork was exhibited at the City Centre Canada Line Station from October 3, 2022 - March 31, 2023.

During the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, artist Janet Wang turned to books as a portal to society and far-flung notions of travelling or gathering with loved ones. When reading Alexandra Chang&rsquo;s &lsquo;Days of Distraction,&rsquo; she came across the word hiraeth, a Welsh word without a precise English translation that the author used to describe her own father&rsquo;s sense of longing for a bygone era or place. The word, with its complete unfamiliarity, unsettled the artist. Its soft, shapely sound, imprecision in translation and elegiac quality encapsulated the last few years.

This work, installed on the west-facing glass wall at the Canada Line City Centre Station asks, in Welsh and other languages, &ldquo;what will we be after we come through this time, where will we be when we take stock of all that has been far and is now near, and all that may return?&rdquo;

&ldquo;To unlock a society, look at its untranslatable words&rdquo;

<td>Bee Humble was exhibited on the Queen Elizabeth Theatre windows from June 2023 - June 2024.

Olivia George&rsquo;s project draws on the kinship between Indigenous communities throughout generations that continue their connections today in their fight for Indigenous sovereignty in the face of threat and trauma. Bumblebees that are native to North America have been vital pollinators, and have for decades, also faced risks and threats, adjusting to changes to continue to do what they are born to do.

George explains: &ldquo;This piece represents community, power, and beauty. My concept is bees breaking free from colonies; us decolonizing. Different hives are breaking out. The confines of the hive will no longer be tolerable. Leaving the colonies together, involving and inviting the community of Vancouver. Vibrating a special humming sound with the spread of all the wings, a song will roar. Allowing pollination of knowledge, truth, and positivity. Together spreading love not hate. Our kinship will keep us together on this journey. Humility of our people has been and will always be important, all shining as bright as the yellow of a bee. Humble bees freely flying and living.&rdquo;</td>

<td>Coming Home To is exhibited on the King Edward Canada Line Station from September 2023 - June 2024.

Robin Robert&rsquo;s Coming Home To, showing on the windows of the Canada Line King Edward Station until March 15, 2024, depicts a pantheon of animals drawn in northern Haida style Formline. The inspiration for the bentwood box frontlet approach came from the artist sketching while listening to Aboriginal Studies professors speak about the Indian Act, the creation of reserves and residential schools. He found himself continually drawing boxes that are representative of attempts to confine or &ldquo;box in&rdquo; Indigeneity.

The work was created in three sections with the left and right windows depicting a bentwood box frontlet figure and a killer whale, representing the water realm. Placing the bentwood box figures on the outer panels was done so that the images are contained within that box. The center window depict from left to right, an eagle with a human figure (sky and earth realms), a Bear Mother story (earth realm), and a raven stealing the sun, with a salmon egg as the sun (sky and water realms). 

This work is presented on translucent vinyl, in part to suggest stained glass windows and the history of religion related to both the artist&rsquo;s family and the church&rsquo;s role in the process of colonization.

Three of Robin&rsquo;s grandparents went to residential school, with the fourth attending day-school. Due to Canadian attempts at erasure, there is a concept in the artist&rsquo;s nation of &ldquo;coming back home,&rdquo; or &ldquo;coming back home to our people, or our culture.&rdquo; This work is in honour of that return. Robin reinforces that narrative with the depiction of the salmon, who is known for its arduous return journey, along with the Haida story of the mother bear &ndash; which is itself, a story of transformation and returning home.</td>

K.C. Hall has created a series of graphic comic book covers that centre around his interpretation of four Heiltsuk raven legends.

The individual pieces, Raven Searches for Light, Raven Steals the Light, Raven the Dying Light, and Raven Becoming the Light, document Raven&rsquo;s search for community, life, and meaning.

The raven character is also a self-portrait series detailing K.C.&rsquo;s journey in finding out who he was as an artist. If you look closely at the posters around town you will see the different influences of stylized drawing, graffiti, urban noir, and Northwest Coast formline.

Raven Steals the Light reveals the artist&rsquo;s sense of humour &ndash; with the double entendre of the smoking raven stealing someone&rsquo;s lighter.</td>

<td>Taking its source elements from the railway and cooperage that used to inhabit the area in the early twentieth century, the art work starts with a galvanized steel track that runs overhead and wanders through the tall buildings between Pacific Boulevard and the False Creek seawall west of the Cambie Street bridge. Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.</td>

The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.</SimpleData>

<td>This bronze figure commemorates athlete Harry Jerome's career as a runner. Jerome was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1940.  By age 18 he became the first man to hold the record in both the 100 yard and the 100 metre runs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he and his sister and their friend Paul Winn were the only black athletes in track in the Canadian National Championships. He ran in three Olympic competitions. In the 1960 Rome Olympics he collapsed on the track with a severely torn hamstring and was labeled a "quitter" by the press. He set another world record in 1962 but later had another fall when his left quadricep muscle group was completely severed.  After surgery and recovery he went on to win the Bronze medal in the 100 metre race at the Tokyo Olympics. Before his retirement in 1968 at 28, he established six world records. He was named BC's Athlete of the Century.  Afterwards he created manuals and sports programs for young people. He received the Order of Canada in 1972 and died suddenly at age 42 in 1982.</td>

<SimpleData name="title_of_work">Harry Jerome</SimpleData>
<SimpleData name="artistprojectstatement">This bronze figure commemorates athlete Harry Jerome's career as a runner. Jerome was born in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in 1940.  By age 18 he became the first man to hold the record in both the 100 yard and the 100 metre runs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he and his sister and their friend Paul Winn were the only black athletes in track in the Canadian National Championships. He ran in three Olympic competitions. In the 1960 Rome Olympics he collapsed on the track with a severely torn hamstring and was labeled a "quitter" by the press. He set another world record in 1962 but later had another fall when his left quadricep muscle group was completely severed.  After surgery and recovery he went on to win the Bronze medal in the 100 metre race at the Tokyo Olympics. Before his retirement in 1968 at 28, he established six world records. He was named BC's Athlete of the Century.  Afterwards he created manuals and sports programs for young people. He received the Order of Canada in 1972 and died suddenly at age 42 in 1982.</SimpleData>

<td>It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, "The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance." Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  "The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space."  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to "all women who have been murdered by men".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, "Marker of Change" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.</td>

<td>The monument consists of a 100' diameter circle of 14 pink granite benches each 5.5' long with a slight bowl in the top.  Each bench is inscribed with the name of one of the 14 women killed by a gunman on December 6th, 1989, at the l'Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal.  The benches are about the length and width of a woman's body and the depression in the center of each bench catches rain water, a reference to tears. A 98' diameter circle outside the benches is set w/ 500 7½" square tiles with the names of donors.
The circle is situated close to the center of the park and makes reference to ancient stone circles. The space inside the circle is slightly domed and covered with grass. An alter-like podium stands just outside the circles and bears the name of the piece and an inscription. Over time, Marker of Change has quietly asserted itself into the consciousness of the community and has become a site for individual reflection and meditation as well as a place of discovery.</td>
